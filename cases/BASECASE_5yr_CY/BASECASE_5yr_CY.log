â”Œ Warning: The active manifest file at `/lustre/eaglefs/projects/mbap/sera/mchung/SERA2.0_dev/SERA.jl/Manifest.toml` has an old format that is being maintained.
â”‚ To update to the new format, which is supported by Julia versions â‰¥ 1.6.2, run `Pkg.upgrade_manifest()` which will upgrade the format without re-resolving.
â”‚ To then record the julia version re-resolve with `Pkg.resolve()` and if there are resolve conflicts consider `Pkg.update()`.
